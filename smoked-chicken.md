## Notes

### 9/23/2017 
 
 + In brine used iodized table salt and the Splenda brown sugar mix because we have a lot of both.  Also added garlic powder but probably won't make much difference.
 + Tried simple injection... wasn't sure if it made a difference or not.  Might skip it next time.
 + Used apple wood for smoke.
 + Had issues maintaining 275 degrees in smoker.  I think 300 is probably OK.
 + Want to experiment with placing chicken in a pan with a little stock in the bottom and covering with foil to finish.  Maybe transfer once color looks good and thigh reaches 160.
 + Probably don't need salt on outside of chicken with the brine.
