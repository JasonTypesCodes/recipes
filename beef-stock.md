# Beef Stock

### Ingredients

  + Beef Soup Bones / Shank Meat (whatever your butcher calls them) (4-6 bones or 2-3 lbs)
  + Carrots (3 or 4 cut in half)
  + Celery (3 or 4 stalks cut in half.  Feel free to use the base that you would normally throw away)
  + Onion (1 cut in half)
  + Garlic (1)
  + Bay Leaves (a few)
  + Vegetable Oil (About a tablespoon)
  + Water

### Instructions
 
  + Coat the bottom of a stock pot with vegetable oil and heat to medium-high
  + Brown both sides of soup bones and set aside.
  + Add a couple cups of water to hot stock pot and use a fork or slotted spoon to remove all the brown pieces stuck to the bottom.
  + Add vegetables and bones to pot and fill with water so that it just covers everything.
  + Place lid on pot and bring to a simmer. (Don't worry, you'll boil later)
  + Allow to simmer for most of the day (at least 6 hours) stirring whenever you get curious about how things are going.
    + At an absolute minimum, wait until the meat has mostly fallen off of the soup bones before continuing.
    + If it seems like the meat is tightening up, the temperature is too high.
  + Using a slotted spoon, remove all of the bones, meat, and veggie chunks you can find.
  + With the lid off, bring the pot to a boil
  + Boil until the desired amount is remaining (Longer you boil, the thicker it gets, which is a good thing... less to store)
  + Turn off burner and allow to get close to room temperature (This might take a while)
  + Put stock pot in the fridge over night (Do not do this while it is still hot)
  + The next day, remove the stock pot and take out the fat that has hardened at the top
  + If it looks like you made beef gelatin, do not be concerned... that means you did it right ;-)
  + Heat up the remaining stock to get it back into a liquid state.
  + Get a smaller pot and a fine wire strainer.  Pour a portion of the stock into the smaller pot through the strainer.
    + You will likely need to clean the strainer a few times during this process.
    + Make it a point to laugh heartily while doing this step because there are people who spend a lot of effort trying to get their  stock as "clear" as possible using coffee filters and the like.
  + Use the smaller pot to start filling mason jars (Leave room for expansion)
  + Freeze
 
## Notes

  + If you get into the habit of saving beef scraps for stock, make sure to focus on saving the bones and meat. Fat will just get skimmed back off the top later.
  + When you use the stock, you will need to decide how much to water it down based on its thickness. For me, "gelatin" stock can be mixed 1:1 with water. Adjust for taste... every batch is different.
