Stout Ham Glaze

Ingredients:

For 5 - 8 pound ham:

1 bottle of your favorite stout
1/2 Cup Honey
1/2 Cup Brown Sugar
1 Tsp Vanilla Extract
1/4 Cup of regular yellow mustard (I like to use a little extra)

1 - Pour a very thin layer of stout in your baking pan.
2 - Place ham in pan, and brush a thin layer of stout on the outside of the ham.
(Be carefull, beer tends to fizz up when cooking, do not add more than a THIN layer
 at this point)
3 - Follow standard baking instructions for ham.
4 - While ham is baking: combine 1/2 cup of stout with honey, brown sugar, vanilla,
and mustard in a small sauce pan. (To thicken/sweeten glaze, add equal amounts of
honey and brown sugar)
5 - Apply high heat to the sauce pan.
6 - Using a small whisk, mildly whisk glaze until it starts to boil.  Continue 
to whisk while boiling for 30 seconds.
7 - Remove completely from heat. (Glaze will thicken when it cools)
====In last hour of baking time====
8 - Remove ham from oven.  If needed, pour additional stout in the bottom of the
baking pan.  Apply a layer of glaze and place back into oven for additional 30 
minutes.
9 - Repeat step 8.
10 - Remove from oven.  Place ham on plate apply final coat of glaze.  Carve.  
Drizzle remaining glaze over carved ham.
11 - Enjoy!
