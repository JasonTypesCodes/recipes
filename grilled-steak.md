# Grilled Steak

## Ingredients

 + 1.5 Inch Steaks
   + Thinner steaks are OK but it is harder to get a good crispy sear without overcooking the center
 + Sea Salt
 + Pepper
 + Garlic Powder

## Instructions

 + Ask Jessi if she would make some of those mushrooms in garlic butter.
 + Pat steaks dry with paper towels.  Get the outside as dry as possible.
 + Coat each side of the steaks with salt, pepper, and garlic powder.
 + Return steaks to the fridge.
 + Figure out what your target temperature is.
   + Consult a temperature/doneness chart as well as the people you are cooking for
   + Subtract 5 degrees to get your target temperature (The steak will cook a bit during the rest)
 + Leave the steaks in the fridge until the last possible moment.  You want to put them on the grill cold.
 + Set up grill for 2 zone cook.
   + Prefer lumb charcoal.  High heat > even temps.
   + Let the charcoal fully light before starting the meat.
 + Put some canola oil on a paper towel and apply to the grill grate
 + Put the steaks on direct heat to sear.  Searing both sides shouldn't take more than a few minutes.
 + Don't close the lid unless you have to because of flare ups.
 + After 1 minute, start checking the sear.  When you have a good crispy sear, flip.
   + If it took you a long time to get a good sear on the first side, don't worry about getting a good sear on the other side.  You are better off with a steak that is the right temerature with one good seared side than an overcooked steak with both sides seared well.
   + If you are worried about the amount of time it took you to get a sear, just check the temp of the steaks now.  If you are at or beyond target temperature.  Take them off the grill and start the rest.   
 + Move the steaks to indirect heat and check temperatures.
 + Cook on indirect heat until your target temperatures are met.
 + Remove steaks and allow to rest for 5 (1 inch) or 7 (1.5 inch) minutes before eating.
