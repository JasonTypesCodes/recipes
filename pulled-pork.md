# Pulled Pork

## Ingredients

 + 1 or more 3 lb pork shoulder or butt roasts.
   + I prefer multiple smaller roasts over a single large roast because they finish sooner, there is more bark, and if you aren't inviting the whole neighborhood over you can just make one.
 + Rub
 + Yellow Mustard
 + Apple Cider Vinegar
 + Apple Juice

## Instructions

 + The day before the cook:
   + Pat the roasts dry with paper towel
   + Coat the roasts in yellow mustard
   + Coat the roasts in rub
   + Wrap with plastic wrap and place in fridge
 + The day of the cook:
   + Leave the roasts in the fridge until you are ready to put them on the smoker
   + Make 50/50 mixture of Apple Cider Vinegar and Apple Juice and set aside
     + Approximately 1/2 cup per roast.
     + Adjust sweetness by varying the amount of apple juice you use
     + Give the remaining apple juice to Alice
   + Start smoker and stabalize around 250-300
   + Remove roasts from the fridge.  Touch up rub on any spots where it has completely dissolved.
   + Add apple wood chunks to smoker and add roasts
   + Cook uncovered until the meat starts to stall (around 170)
   + If the outer color/texture doesn't look great when the stall starts:
     + Drop smoker temperature to 220
     + Use the stall to get the outer color/texture that you want
   + When you are happy with the outer color/texture, wrap each roast with 2 pieces of heavy duty aluminum foil with some of the apple cider vinegar and apple juice mixture from above.
     + Try to avoid using cheap foil.  It will leak and stick and burn and it just isn't worth it.
   + Allow smoker temp to rise back if you adjusted for the stall
   + Cook until meat is 200
     + If you spent the entire stall getting the color/texture you wanted and it is already 200, just go straight to the cooler.
   + Line the bottom of a cooler with a clean towel and place the foil-wrapper roasts on it.  Place another clean towel on top and close the cooler.
   + Allow meat to rest in the cooler for 1-2 hours.
   + Remove from cooler, unwrap and place roasts and the juice from the foil into a large dish
   + Using 2 forks, pull the pork apart
   + If desired, sprinkle a little rub on top and/or add a little of the cider/juice mixture
   + I think you have it from here.
